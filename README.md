# NewPluginsManager

Utility that notifies you when new plugins are added to Vencord

## Installation

See https://docs.vencord.dev/installing/custom-plugins/

<sub>I recommend using the default `src/userplugins` folder for this, even if you have a system where 3rd party plugins are imported as Git submodules.</sub>
